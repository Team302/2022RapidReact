What do we want Swerve to do:
    Drive in both axis' (x and y), turn around third (z)
        -Standard Ether Code
    Turn About Point/Wheel
        -Addition to Ether Code
    Maintain Heading
    Odometry/Position information
    "Re-zero" if Odometry is messed update
    Turn To Heading

Classes:
    SwerveChassis: Houses Ether Code and any low level swerve module stuff, sends module states to motors
    SwerveDrive: Forwards all swerve functions to SwerveChassis
    SwerveUtils: Handles all position information and helper functions
    SwerveSpecial: Handles any special swerve functions (Turn about point, turn to heading?, drive to point, etc.), sends to SwerveDrive
